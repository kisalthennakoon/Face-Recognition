## Introduction
The Face Recognition System is a machine learning project that utilizes OpenCV’s Cascade Classifier and the EigenFaceRecognizer for recognizing faces. The system can capture images from a camera feed, detect faces, and recognize known individuals based on a pre-trained model. This project is designed for real-time recognition, making it suitable for applications in security and personal identification.

## Features
- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Detects faces in real-time using OpenCV’s Cascade Classifier.
- **Face Recognition**: Recognizes known faces using the EigenFaceRecognizer model.
- **Camera Integration**: Captures live video feed from a webcam for face detection and recognition.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple interface to start recognizing faces quickly.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries:

- `cv2` (OpenCV)
- `numpy`

## Usage
1. Go to jupyter notebook in Face Recognition folder.
2. Import libraries from first block.
3. In the second block change output folder variable for each new user wich you need to recognize. (output_folder = "data/at/new_user_name")
4. Run remaining blocks as instructed above cells.

Note: press any key to exit from camera window
